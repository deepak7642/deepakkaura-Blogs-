### Blog 2 : Clustering (Part-1 about its meaning )
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.
### Blog 2 : Clustering (Part-2  Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning )
In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well "labeled." It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.
A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled training data, helps you to predict outcomes for unforeseen data.

Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.
